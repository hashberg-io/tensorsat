    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the TensorSAT project is to build an SMT solver based on techniques analogous to [hyper-optimized tensor network contraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01935) techniques used in quantum simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, TensorSAT replaces predicates and formulae with categorical diagrams, taking their idealised semantics into the [hypergraph category](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08304) of sets and relations.\n",
    "Functions and predicates are replaced by general relations, with synthetic composition rules used to contract diagrams and compute answers to satisfiability problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **diagram** is formed by **wiring** together **boxes** from one or more **languages**, compatibly with the **types** specified by the boxes' **ports**.\n",
    "Every language defines (parametrised families of) boxes and types, together with computational semantics in the form of contractions for arbitrary wirings of boxes in the language.\n",
    "Such conctractions can be reduced to three special cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `spider`: converts a wire &mdash; connecting any positive number of ports &mdash; into a box in the language.\n",
    "- `transpose`: reorders the ports of any box in the language.\n",
    "- `contract2`: contracts arbitrary wirings of any two boxes in the language (wired ports may be left open, but no copying is allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages are allowed to overlap in boxes and types, and diagrams can involve boxes from multiple languages."

    "### A Categorical Aside\n",
    "\n",
    "In categorical terms, each language is the hypergraph category freely generated by a parametrised family of types (object generators) and boxes (morphism generators).\n",
    "Boxes are normalised to have the tensor unit as their domain: their signature takes the form $I \\rightarrow X_0 \\otimes ... \\otimes X_{n-1}$, the indices $\\lbrace 0, ..., n-1 \\rbrace$ are the ports of the box, and we say that the generator $X_j$ is the type of port $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A diagram involving boxes from one or more languages is a diagram in hypergraph category freely-generated by the union of their types and boxes.\n",
    "The wiring of boxes in a diagram is a normalised representation of the diagram's compositional structure modulo the axioms of hypergraph categories (cf. [arXiv:1512.01602](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01602)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, languages have semantics in the hypergraph category Rel of sets and finitary relations.\n",
    "Computationally, the semantics for each individual language are captured by providing an implementation for the `spider`, `transpose` and `contract2` rewrites which is sound for the Rel semantics (i.e. one such that the rewrite corresponds to an equation in Rel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the rewrites equations turning a diagram in the language (two boxes, one box, and no boxes, respectively) into a single box in the same language.\n",
    "Taken together, they give rise to a strongly confluent rewriting system which can be used to contract arbitrary diagrams in the language into a single box of the same language, providing computational semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types and boxes for multiple languages are allowed to overlap, and it is requried that the Rel semantics be compatible over such overlaps; that is, multiple languages assign the same set semantics to the same type, and the same relation semantics to the same box, whenever they have types and/or boxes in common.\n",
    "Because of this, contraction in diagrams involving multiple languages does not necessarily result in a confluent rewriting system."
