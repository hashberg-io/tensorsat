"""
TensorSAT is a suite of SAT/SMT solvers based on hyper-optimised contraction of diagrams
for compact-closed categories (e.g. binary sets and relations, in the case of SAT).
This includes cases where multiple compact-closed categories coexist in the same hybrid
diagram, and the case where contraction includes selected intermediate rewriting steps.
